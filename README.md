## Overview

The U-Channel Software is a Python package designed for generating and working with parametric models of U-shaped sheet metals. The package includes four distinct parametric models, each defined by geometric dimensions, angles, and fillet radii. These models enable users to create an infinite variety of U-shaped sheet metal geometries, which can be exported as STEP files for CAE applications.
The key features of the package are:

- Parametric Models: Generate custom U-shaped geometries inspired by real-world shapes.
- Feasibility Check: Includes a plausibility check to validate the geometries.
- Visualization: Create detailed images of the generated geometries.
- Parallel Processing: Efficiently generate geometries and images in parallel.

For more information, please refer to the associated [publication(s)](#cite-this-work). This project is currently classified as **stable**, which means that it can be used as a [package](#installation) in its current state. Changes, updates, and new features may occur over time in the form of new versions.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use the following command via pip to install the latest version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ToLe814/uchannel.git -U
```

If you want to install a specific version, adapt this pip installation command:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ToLe814/uchannel.git@1.0.0
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the package locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToLe814/uchannel.git
cd uchannel
pip install .
```


## Requirements
We refer to the pyproject.toml file.	
	

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example of using the U-Channel package with one of the four parametric models after installation:
```python
from uchannel.uchannel1 import UChannel1
from pathlib import Path

# Define directories and paths
work_dir = r"path/to/your/working/directory"
path_geom = Path(work_dir) / 'uchannel1.step'

# Instantiate the geometry
u1 = UChannel1(path_geom, x_1=100, x_2=105, y_l=50, y_r=50, z_l_1=33.3, z_l_2=33.3, z_r_1=33.3, z_r_2=33.3,
               offset_mp_1=(1, 1, 1), offset_mp_2=(1, 1, 1), r_l=(5, 5), r_r=(5, 5),
               beta_l_1=15, beta_l_2=15, beta_r_1=15, beta_r_2=15, y_sa=50, sa=True)

# Check the feasibility
if u1.check_feasibility():
        # Create the geometry
        u1.gmsh_filleting = True
        u1.create_geometry(export=True, gui=True)
```
Find running examples of feasible geometry creation in the respective project files. Explanation for the parameters can be found in the comments, [sketches](./sketches/), or in the associated [publication(s)](#cite-this-work). Currently, there is no documentation of the code.
